## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, high-quality visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For enhancing visualizations and statistical plotting.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and presentation.

## Analysis Highlights

This analysis covers several key aspects of Netflix's content:

* **Content Type Distribution:** Breakdown of Movies vs. TV Shows.
* **Temporal Growth:** Trends in content added to Netflix over the years.
* **Geographical Footprint:** Top content-producing countries.
